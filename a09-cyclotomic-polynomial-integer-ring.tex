In \autoref{sec:roots} and \autoref{sec:cyclotomic}, we learned about the definition and properties of the $\mu$-th roots of unity and the $\mu$-th cyclotomic polynomial over complex numbers (i.e., $X \in \mathbb{C}$) as follows: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The $\bm \mu$-th roots of unity} are the solutions in $\mathbb{C}$ to the equation $X^\mu = 1$. In other words, all $\mu$-th roots of unity can be written as $X = e^{2 \pi i k / \mu}$ for integers $k$ with $0 \le k < \mu$.
\item \textbf{The primitive $\bm \mu$-th roots of unity (denoted as $\bm \omega$)} are those $\mu$-th roots of unity whose order (\autoref{subsec:order-def}) is $\mu$ (i.e., $\omega^{\mu} = 1$ and $\omega^d \neq 1$ for any $1 \le d < \mu$ with $d \mid \mu$).
\item Given any primitive $\mu$-th roots of unity $\omega$, one can generate all primitive $\mu$-th roots of unity by computing $\omega^{k'}$ such that $k'$ is an integer $0 < k' < \mu$ and $\textsf{gcd}(k', \mu) = 1$ (Theorem~\ref*{subsec:roots-theorem}.4 in \autoref{subsec:order-theorem}). 
\item \textbf{The $\bm \mu$-th cyclotomic polynomial} is defined as a polynomial whose roots are the primitive $\mu$-th roots of unity. That is, \[ \Phi_{\mu}(x) = \prod_{\omega \in P({\mu})} (x - \omega) = \prod_{\substack{0 \leq k \leq {\mu}-1,\\ \textsf{gcd}(k, {\mu}) = 1}} (x - \omega^k) \]
\end{itemize}

In this section, we will explain the $\mu$-th cyclotomic polynomial over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ (with $p$ prime), which is structured as follows:

\begin{tcolorbox}[title={\textbf{\tboxdef{\ref*{sec:cyclotomic-polynomial-integer-ring}} Roots of Unity and Cyclotomic Polynomial over Finite Fielf $\mathbb{Z}_p$}}]


\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The $\bm \mu$-th roots of unity (denoted as $\bm \omega$)} are the solutions for $X^\mu \equiv 1 \bmod p$. Note that in contrast to the complex case, these solutions cannot be expressed as $X = e^{2 \pi i k / \mu}$. 
\item \textbf{The primitive $\bm \mu$-th roots of unity} are defined as those $\mu$-th roots of unity whose order is $\mu$ (i.e., $\omega^{\mu} \equiv 1 \bmod p$, and $\omega^d \not\equiv 1 \bmod p$ for any $1 \le d < \mu$ with $d \mid \mu$). 
\item Given any primitive $\mu$-th roots of unity $\omega$, it can generate all primitive $\mu$-th roots of unity by computing $\omega^{k'}$ such that $k'$ is an integer $0 < k' < \mu$ and $\textsf{gcd}(k', \mu) = 1$.
\item \textbf{The $\bm \mu$-th cyclotomic polynomial} is defined as a polynomial whose roots are the primitive $\mu$-th roots of unity. That is, \[ \Phi_{\mu}(x) = \prod_{\omega \in P({\mu})} (x - \omega) = \prod_{\substack{0 \leq k \leq {\mu}-1,\\ \textsf{gcd}(k, {\mu}) = 1}} (x - \omega^k) \]
\end{itemize}

Note that in the $\mu$-th cyclotomic polynomial, in both cases of over $X \in \mathbb{C}$ and over $X \in \mathbb{Z}_p$, each of their roots $\omega$ (i.e., the primitive $\mu$-th root of unity) has the order $\mu$ (i.e., $\omega^{\mu} = 1$ over $X \in \mathbb{C}$, and $\omega^{\mu} \equiv 1 \bmod p$ over $X \in \mathbb{Z}_p$). Also note that each root $\omega$ can generate all roots of the $\mu$-th cyclotomic polynomial by computing $\omega^{k'}$ such that $\textsf{gcd}(k', \mu) = 1$.

\autoref{tab:cyclotomic-polynomial-comparison} compares the properties of the roots of unity and the $\mu$-th cyclotomic polynomial over $\mathbb{C}$ (the complex numbers) and over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ (the ring).
